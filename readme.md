This website is a portfolio of software development that I have done. I intend
for it to be a complete running list (barring company projects I can't
disclose). You can find the site at piludu.io. It is updated as frequently as
possible.

The site was written with Python 3.8.0, Django 3.0.7, and Bootstrap 4.5.0.
